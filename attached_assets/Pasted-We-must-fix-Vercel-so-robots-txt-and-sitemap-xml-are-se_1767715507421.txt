We must fix Vercel so /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml are served as real static files, not routed into the SPA.

Create/verify these files exist EXACTLY in public/ (not src/, not client/src/):
public/robots.txt with:
User-agent: *
Allow: /
 
Sitemap: https://www.compressyourphoto.com/sitemap.xml
public/ads.txt with:
# ads.txt placeholder until AdSense approval
Replace public/sitemap.xml with a VALID XML sitemap (must include <urlset> and <url> entries). Use this exact list of URLs and REMOVE /about unless there is a real route/page:
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/

Open vercel.json (create it if missing) and ensure routing does NOT intercept these static files.
Use this config:
json
Copy
{
  "headers": [
    { "source": "/robots.txt", "headers": [{ "key": "Content-Type", "value": "text/plain; charset=utf-8" }] },
    { "source": "/ads.txt", "headers": [{ "key": "Content-Type", "value": "text/plain; charset=utf-8" }] },
    { "source": "/sitemap.xml", "headers": [{ "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/xml; charset=utf-8" }] }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/robots.txt", "destination": "/robots.txt" },
    { "source": "/sitemap.xml", "destination": "/sitemap.xml" },
    { "source": "/ads.txt", "destination": "/ads.txt" },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
After making changes, tell me which files you created/edited, and their paths.
Then Commit + Push so Vercel redeploys.

Important: verify you actually deployed the latest commit
After you push, go to Vercel → Deployments and confirm the latest deployment matches the time you pushed.

If you want a quick sanity check without guessing: tell me the latest GitHub commit message/time and I’ll tell you what to look for in Vercel.

Once you re-push, I’ll re-check live again
