Replit is telling the truth about what Vercel deployed (commit 88f55cf is indeed in Production), but production is still serving the wrong robots.txt / sitemap.xml and the English homepage still says “8 languages” when I fetch it publicly.

That combination usually means the build output being deployed does not actually contain the files/content Replit thinks it contains, or Vercel is deploying a build where those files are in the wrong place for Vite, so they never get served at /{file}.

What your Vercel screenshot proves
From your deployment details:

Environment: Production (Current)
Source: main @ 88f55cf
Framework: Vite 5.4.20
Build output shows: ../dist/public/index.html etc.
So: Vercel is deploying the latest commit correctly. This is not a “Vercel didn’t deploy” issue.

What the live site still proves
Right now, publicly:

robots.txt → SPA 404 page (should be plain text)
sitemap.xml → not valid XML
homepage → still says 8 languages
So: the deployed build is not producing what you expected.

The most likely root cause (90%+)
In a Vite project:

Files must be in public/robots.txt and public/sitemap.xml (project root).
They are copied to the build output root and served as:
/robots.txt
/sitemap.xml
If instead they are in:

src/public/...
dist/public/... manually
some other folder (or generated at runtime by router)
…then Vercel will not serve them as expected, and your SPA rewrite will catch them (leading to the SPA 404 you’re seeing).

Also: your build log suggests output is being created under /dist/public/... which hints your project might have a custom outDir / base path setup that’s not standard, and that can break where static root files end up.

How to verify in 2 minutes (no guessing)
Step 1 — Check the deployed “Static Assets” list in Vercel
On the same deployment page you shared:

Go to Deployment Summary → Static Assets
Filter Misc
Look for:
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
ads.txt (optional)
If you do NOT see robots.txt and sitemap.xml there, then they are not in the build output, regardless of what Replit says.

Step 2 — Open the file directly in the deployment output (if possible)
Vercel UI sometimes lets you click an asset and see its path. Confirm it is exactly:

/robots.txt
/sitemap.xml
Fix (works even if “everything is already configured”)
You want the simplest “force-correct” approach:

Required structure in repo
public/robots.txt
public/sitemap.xml
Also ensure Vercel rewrite is not intercepting them
Even with SPA rewrites, Vercel should serve existing static files first, but if you have a misconfigured rewrite, it can override.

Minimal vercel.json that is safe
json
Copy
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
Vercel will still serve /robots.txt and /sitemap.xml if they exist in output.

If you have more complex rewrites that accidentally override, simplify.

Why the homepage still says “8 languages”
That means the deployed JS/translation JSON/text for the English homepage is still the older copy.

This can happen if:

the English homepage text is hardcoded in one component and Replit only updated another locale file, or
you have two different English entry pages (/ vs /compress), and only one got updated.
What I need from you to pinpoint exactly
On your Vercel deployment page (the one you linked), in Static Assets → Misc, do you see:

robots.txt (yes/no)
sitemap.xml (yes/no)
Reply with just:

robots: yes/no
sitemap: yes/no
…and I’ll tell you the exact next step (either “files missing from build output” or “rewrites overriding existing files”).
