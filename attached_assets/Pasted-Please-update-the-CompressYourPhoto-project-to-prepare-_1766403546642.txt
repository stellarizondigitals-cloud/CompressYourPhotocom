Please update the CompressYourPhoto project to prepare for monetisation and analytics, while keeping everything 100% client-side and free-tier friendly (no backend, no paid APIs).

1) Google Analytics 4 Integration
---------------------------------
I will paste my GA4 Measurement ID later, so please:

- Create a small helper in the client app to load GA4 when an environment variable is present.
- In `index.html` or the main entry, add a placeholder comment where the GA4 script will go, with clear instructions like:
  <!-- GA4 script goes here when G-XXXX is available -->

- In React, create a small utility (e.g. `src/lib/analytics.ts`) with:
  - `initAnalytics(measurementId: string)` – loads GA4 script dynamically.
  - `trackPageView(path: string)` – sends a page_view to GA4.
- In `App.tsx` (or the main router), call:
  - `initAnalytics(import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID)` once on mount if the env var exists.
  - `trackPageView(location.pathname)` whenever the route changes.

Make sure:
- No errors occur if `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is not set.
- Everything remains purely client-side and works on Vercel Hobby free tier.

2) Add a Monetisation / Recommendations Section
-----------------------------------------------
On the home page, above the footer, add a new section called "Recommended Tools" that is ready for affiliate links or AdSense later.

Design:
- H2: "Recommended Tools"
- Short paragraph: "Here are some useful tools you might like. Some of these links may be affiliate links."
- Three cards laid out responsively:
  1) "Backup Your Photos"
     Description: "Use a secure cloud storage provider to keep your compressed photos safe."
     Button: "Learn more" with placeholder href `#`
  2) "Edit Before You Compress"
     Description: "Crop, rotate, and adjust your photos using a free online editor."
     Button: "Open editor" with placeholder href `#`
  3) "Optimize Your Website Images"
     Description: "Developers can use automated tools to compress images as part of their build pipeline."
     Button: "View developer tools" with placeholder href `#`

Implementation details:
- Use the same card styling as the existing feature cards for visual consistency.
- Keep text and headings translatable with i18next (add new translation keys).
- For now, use `href="#"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` on the buttons, so I can replace them later with real affiliate URLs.

3) Keep Everything Free-tier Friendly
-------------------------------------
- Do NOT add any backend API routes or databases.
- Do NOT add any new paid SDKs or heavy analytics libraries.
- The GA4 integration should only load the Google script from `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=...` when a measurement ID is configured.
- Ensure the build still works with Vite and deploys to Vercel without extra configuration.

Finally, summarize:
- Where to put my GA4 Measurement ID (which env var or which code line).
- Which files were changed for the monetisation section so I can review them.
