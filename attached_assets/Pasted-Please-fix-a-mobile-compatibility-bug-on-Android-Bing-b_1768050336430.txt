Please fix a mobile compatibility bug: on Android Bing browser, when users click “Download” after converting an image, nothing happens. On mobile Chrome it works. This suggests the current download implementation is not compatible with Bing/WebView.

Requirements
Make downloads work reliably on mobile Bing, Chrome, Samsung Internet, and iOS Safari.
Support:
Single file download (converted image)
Batch ZIP download (if present)
Keep current UX, but ensure the final “Download” action is triggered in a way that preserves a user gesture and avoids blocked programmatic clicks.
Implementation guidance (do all of this)
Locate the existing download helper/util (e.g. downloadFile, downloadBlob, saveAs, etc.) used by Convert tool and other tools.
Replace the download logic with a robust cross-browser strategy:
Strategy
Primary method:
Create an <a> element with href = objectURL and download = filename
Append to DOM
Call a.click() immediately inside the same synchronous click handler if possible
Remove element
Important: On some WebViews/Bing, a.click() may fail silently.
Add a fallback: window.location.href = objectURL (or window.open(objectURL, "_self")) when a.click() does not start a download.
Ensure the objectURL is not revoked too early:
Delay URL.revokeObjectURL(objectURL) by at least 30–60 seconds (or after a timeout), not immediately after click.
Ensure the download click is truly user-initiated:
The “Download” button should call the download function synchronously.
If conversion is async, store the result blob in state first, then the user clicks Download as a separate action. Do not auto-download after async work on Bing.
If ZIP downloads are used:
Confirm ZIP is generated as a Blob (application/zip)
Use the same robust download method above
Same delayed revoke rule
Add debug logging (temporary):
Log userAgent and which download path was used (anchor vs fallback)
Keep logs behind a if (import.meta.env.DEV) guard
Acceptance tests
On Android Bing:
Convert an image → click Download → file downloads
On Android Chrome:
Still works
On iPhone Safari:
Download either triggers share sheet or downloads (acceptable), but must not do nothing
No console errors in production build
After implementing, run the app, test locally, then commit with message:
Fix mobile Bing download fallback

Why this will fix it (in plain terms)
Bing mobile sometimes blocks the “synthetic click download” pattern unless:

it’s directly tied to a user click, and/or
you use a navigation fallback, and/or
you don’t revoke the blob URL too quickly.
This prompt forces your implementation to satisfy all three.

One more thing (very important)
If your current flow is auto-downloading immediately after conversion completes, change it to:

show a Download button once the blob is ready,
then download only when the user taps.
That single change fixes a huge chunk of WebView/Bing failures.
