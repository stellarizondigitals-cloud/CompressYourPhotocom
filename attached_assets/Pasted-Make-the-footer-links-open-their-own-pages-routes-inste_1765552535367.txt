Make the footer links open their own pages (routes) instead of doing nothing. Keep everything free-tier friendly (no backend, no paid APIs, no server database).

Tech constraints:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Use existing router setup (react-router-dom)
- No new backend or paid services
- Pages should be static content components

Tasks:

1) Create these new pages in `src/pages/`:
- HowItWorks.tsx  -> route: /how-it-works
- Languages.tsx   -> route: /languages
- PrivacyPolicy.tsx -> route: /privacy-policy
- Terms.tsx         -> route: /terms
- CookiePolicy.tsx  -> route: /cookie-policy
- Disclaimer.tsx    -> route: /disclaimer
- Contact.tsx       -> route: /contact

Each page should:
- Use the same Header and Footer layout as the home page
- Have an H1 title and readable typography (Tailwind)
- Be responsive
- Use i18next keys for headings and important text where reasonable (at minimum English; other languages can fallback if needed)

2) Update routing in App.tsx so these routes render the correct pages.
Keep the existing language routing approach intact if present.

3) Update Footer links so they navigate using <Link to="...">:
- "How It Works" -> /how-it-works
- "Privacy Policy" -> /privacy-policy
- Add "Terms" -> /terms
- Add "Cookie Policy" -> /cookie-policy
- Add "Disclaimer" -> /disclaimer
- "Languages" -> /languages
- Add "Contact" -> /contact
- "GitHub" stays an external link (target=_blank, rel=noopener noreferrer) to: https://github.com/stellarizondigitals-cloud/CompressYourPhotocom

4) Fill each page with complete, high-quality writing that matches the product:

How It Works page content:
- Explain that compression happens in the browser
- Steps: Upload -> Choose settings (quality, width, format) -> Compress -> Download single/ZIP
- Mention supported formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, GIF)

Languages page content:
- List the 8 supported languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Hindi, Simplified Chinese, Arabic
- Mention RTL support for Arabic
- Explain language switcher and localized URLs if used

Privacy Policy page content (clear & AdSense-friendly):
- Operator: Stellarizon Digitals Ltd
- State: images are processed client-side; not uploaded or stored
- Analytics: may use Google Analytics 4; no image data is sent
- Ads/affiliates: may use Google AdSense + affiliate links; third parties may set cookies
- Cookies: essential vs analytics/ads; user controls via browser
- Contact email: contact@stellarizondigitals.com
- Last updated date shown at top

Terms page content (simple & practical):
- Service provided “as is”
- User responsibility for rights to images
- No guarantee of fitness
- Limitation of liability
- Changes to service/terms
- Governing law: England and Wales (since company is in London)
- Contact email

Cookie Policy page content:
- What cookies are
- Categories: essential, analytics, advertising
- How to manage cookies (browser settings)
- Mention AdSense may use cookies for ad personalization (without making legal claims beyond that)

Disclaimer page content:
- Not professional advice
- Compression results vary
- No warranty; use at your own risk
- Third-party links disclaimer

Contact page content:
- Short paragraph inviting support/feedback
- Email: contact@stellarizondigitals.com
- Optionally include a simple mailto link button
- No form submission backend (keep free-tier)

5) Add basic SEO per page using document title + meta description.
If a simple SEO helper component exists, reuse it; otherwise create a minimal `Seo.tsx` component to set:
- document.title
- meta[name="description"]
No external libs required.

6) Ensure links now work in production on Vercel (client-side routing). If needed, confirm Vercel handles SPA routes correctly (Vite static build).
