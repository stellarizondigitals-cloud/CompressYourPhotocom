You are adding a 5th tool to compressyourphoto.com: "Enhance Your Photo."

The site already has 4 working tools: Compress, Resize, Convert, and Crop.

You must now add: Enhance.

This tool must work 100% client-side using Canvas and CSS filters. No backend, no API calls, no uploads to server.

Here is what you must do:

---

### 1. CREATE /enhance PAGE

#### UI Components:
- Drag-and-drop or file picker (supports JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Live side-by-side preview:
  - Left: Original image
  - Right: Enhanced image (live preview of adjustments)
- One-click "Auto-Enhance" button:
  - Automatically applies moderate improvements:
    - Brightness: +10%
    - Contrast: +15%
    - Saturation: +10%
    - Sharpness: slight edge enhancement
  - User can see the result immediately and adjust further with sliders if needed
- Manual adjustment sliders (with live preview):
  1. Brightness (-100 to +100, default 0)
  2. Contrast (-100 to +100, default 0)
  3. Saturation (-100 to +100, default 0)
  4. Sharpness (0 to 100, default 0)
- Optional quick filter buttons:
  - Black & White
  - Sepia
  - Vivid (high saturation boost)
  - Reset (back to original)
- Download button (exports the enhanced image as JPG or PNG, user can choose)
- Privacy assurance text: "100% private—all processing happens in your browser"

#### Implementation:
- Use HTML5 Canvas to apply filters:
  - Brightness/Contrast/Saturation: use Canvas context filters or pixel manipulation
  - Sharpness: convolution filter (kernel sharpening) or CSS filter approximation
- Render the original image on one canvas, apply filters to a second canvas for preview
- On download, export the enhanced canvas as image file

#### Page Metadata:
- Page title: "Enhance Photo Online | Free Image Quality Enhancer"
- Meta description: "Improve your photo quality instantly. Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness for free. 100% private and client-side."
- Canonical URL: https://www.compressyourphoto.com/enhance

---

### 2. UPDATE NAVIGATION
- Add "Enhance" link to the main navigation bar (alongside Compress, Resize, Convert, Crop)
- Order should be logical, e.g.:
  - Home
  - Compress
  - Resize
  - Convert
  - Crop
  - Enhance
  - (Language switcher stays on the right)

---

### 3. UPDATE HOMEPAGE (/)
- Update the hero subtitle to reflect 5 tools:
  "Compress, resize, convert, crop, and enhance your photos—fast, private, and free."
- If there is a 4-card tool selector grid on the homepage, add a 5th card for "Enhance":
  - Icon/emoji: ✨ or 🎨
  - Title: "Enhance"
  - Description: "Improve brightness, contrast, and sharpness"
  - Link: /enhance

---

### 4. UPDATE SEO FILES
- Add the new tool page to public/sitemap.xml:
  - https://www.compressyourphoto.com/enhance
- Also add localized versions for all supported languages:
  - /es/enhance
  - /pt/enhance
  - /fr/enhance
  - /de/enhance
  - /hi/enhance
  - /zh-cn/enhance
  - /ar/enhance

- Ensure sitemap.xml remains valid XML with proper <urlset>, <url>, <loc>, <lastmod>, <changefreq>, <priority> tags.

---

### 5. KEEP EVERYTHING CLIENT-SIDE & FREE-TIER
- Do NOT use any external APIs (e.g., no AI upscaling APIs, no cloud services)
- All image processing must happen in the browser using Canvas
- Files are never uploaded to a server
- Keep performance fast—optimize Canvas operations for mobile devices

---

### 6. DESIGN & UX CONSISTENCY
- Use the same Tailwind CSS styling as the other 4 tools
- Ensure mobile-responsive (sliders work on touch devices)
- Match button styles, drag-and-drop zone, download flow, and privacy messaging
- Add tooltips or help text to explain what each slider does (e.g., "Brightness: Make your photo lighter or darker")

---

### 7. i18n SUPPORT
- Ensure all UI text on the /enhance page is translatable using the existing i18n setup
- Add translation keys for:
  - "Enhance Your Photo"
  - "Auto-Enhance"
  - "Brightness", "Contrast", "Saturation", "Sharpness"
  - "Black & White", "Sepia", "Vivid", "Reset"
  - "Download Enhanced Photo"
- If translation files (en.json, es.json, etc.) need to be updated, add the keys with English defaults and placeholder text for other languages (I will provide real translations later if needed)

---

### 8. ROUTING
- Ensure the new /enhance route works with the existing React Router (wouter or react-router)
- Ensure language-prefixed routes also work (e.g., /es/enhance, /zh-cn/enhance)

---

### 9. KEEP EXISTING FEATURES INTACT
- Do NOT break:
  - Existing 4 tools (Compress, Resize, Convert, Crop)
  - Footer, legal pages, language switcher
  - Recommended Tools section
  - Any existing SEO files (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, ads.txt)

---

### 10. AFTER COMPLETION
- Tell me which files you created/edited
- Confirm /enhance is functional and routable
- Confirm sitemap and navigation are updated

Do NOT ask me for clarification—use best practices for client-side Canvas image filters and build a working, user-friendly Enhance tool.

Begin now.
