You are upgrading compressyourphoto.com from a single-tool site to a 4-in-1 photo power tool suite.

The site currently has one tool: Compress. You must add 3 new tools: Resize, Convert, and Crop.

All tools must work 100% client-side (no backend, no uploads to server) using browser APIs and libraries like browser-image-compression, pica, and canvas.

Here is what you must do:

---

### 1. UPDATE HOMEPAGE (/)
- Keep the existing hero, but change the subtitle to reflect all 4 tools:
  "Compress, resize, convert, and crop your photos—fast, private, and free."

- Replace or augment the current single compressor UI with a "Tool Selector" or 4-card grid that lets users choose:
  1. Compress
  2. Resize
  3. Convert
  4. Crop

- Each card should link to a dedicated tool page:
  - /compress
  - /resize
  - /convert
  - /crop

- Update the feature section to reflect the new capabilities (4 tools, not just compression).

- Keep the existing "Recommended Tools" section, footer, language switcher, and legal page links unchanged.

---

### 2. CREATE DEDICATED TOOL PAGES

#### A) /compress
- Move the existing compress functionality here (drag-and-drop, format badges, quality slider, download).
- Keep the existing logic intact.
- Page title: "Compress Your Photos | Free Online Image Compressor"
- Meta description: "Compress JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, and GIF images for free. Fast, private, client-side compression."

#### B) /resize
- UI:
  - Drag-and-drop or file picker
  - Options to resize by:
    1. Target width/height (keep aspect ratio checkbox)
    2. Percentage (e.g., 50%)
    3. Presets: Instagram Post (1080x1080), Instagram Story (1080x1920), YouTube Thumbnail (1280x720), LinkedIn (1200x627), WhatsApp DP (500x500), Passport Photo (600x600)
  - Live preview of resized dimensions
  - Download button
- Use canvas or pica library to resize client-side.
- Page title: "Resize Image Online | Free Photo Resizer"
- Meta description: "Resize images by pixels, percentage, or preset sizes for Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and more."

#### C) /convert
- UI:
  - Drag-and-drop or file picker (supports JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, GIF, BMP)
  - Dropdown or radio buttons to choose output format: JPG, PNG, WebP
  - If converting to JPG, add quality slider (default 90)
  - If converting to PNG/WebP, option to preserve transparency (if supported)
  - Batch convert support (multiple files → ZIP download)
  - Show original format and target format clearly
  - Download button (single file or ZIP for batch)
- Use canvas and browser APIs to convert formats.
- For HEIC, use heic2any library (install if needed: npm install heic2any) or instruct user that HEIC must be converted first in browser.
- Page title: "Convert Image Format Online | JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC Converter"
- Meta description: "Convert images between JPG, PNG, WebP, and HEIC formats for free. Fast, private, client-side conversion."

#### D) /crop
- UI:
  - Drag-and-drop or file picker
  - Interactive crop box (use a simple crop library like react-easy-crop or build with canvas)
  - Presets:
    1. Square (1:1)
    2. Instagram Story (9:16)
    3. YouTube Thumbnail (16:9)
    4. Circle Avatar (export as PNG with transparency, circular mask)
    5. Free Crop (user drags corners)
  - Live preview
  - Download button
- Page title: "Crop Image Online | Free Photo Cropper"
- Meta description: "Crop images for Instagram, YouTube, or create circle avatars. Free online photo cropper."

---

### 3. NAVIGATION & ROUTING
- Add a top navigation bar or sticky header with links to:
  - Home (/)
  - Compress (/compress)
  - Resize (/resize)
  - Convert (/convert)
  - Crop (/crop)
  - Language switcher (keep existing)

- Ensure all routes work with the existing React Router setup (wouter or react-router).

- Keep the existing i18n path-based routing (/es, /zh-cn, etc.) and ensure the new tool pages also respect language prefixes (e.g., /es/resize).

---

### 4. SEO UPDATES
- Update public/sitemap.xml to include the new tool pages:
  - https://www.compressyourphoto.com/compress
  - https://www.compressyourphoto.com/resize
  - https://www.compressyourphoto.com/convert
  - https://www.compressyourphoto.com/crop

- For each language, also include localized versions (e.g., /es/compress, /fr/resize, etc.).

- Ensure each tool page has unique <title>, meta description, and canonical URL.

- Add hreflang tags for multilingual versions of each tool page.

---

### 5. KEEP EVERYTHING CLIENT-SIDE & FREE-TIER
- Do NOT introduce any backend API calls.
- Use existing libraries (browser-image-compression, pica, canvas) or add lightweight ones if needed (heic2any, react-easy-crop).
- All processing happens in the browser.
- Files are never uploaded to a server.
- Privacy messaging ("100% private, no upload") should appear on every tool page.

---

### 6. DESIGN & UX
- Keep the existing Tailwind CSS styling and color scheme.
- Make the UI consistent across all 4 tools (same buttons, drag-and-drop zones, download flow).
- Ensure mobile-responsive (all tools work on mobile).
- Add clear labels, tooltips, and help text where needed.

---

### 7. KEEP EXISTING FEATURES INTACT
- Do NOT break:
  - Existing compress tool logic
  - Footer (Trust & Performance, legal links, contact email)
  - Language switcher and i18n
  - Legal pages (/privacy-policy, /terms, etc.)
  - Recommended Tools section (we'll update affiliate links later)

---

### 8. AFTER COMPLETION
- Tell me which files you created/edited.
- Confirm all 4 tools are functional and routable.
- Confirm sitemap and meta tags are updated.

Do NOT ask me for clarification—use best practices for client-side image processing and build working, user-friendly tools.

Begin now.
