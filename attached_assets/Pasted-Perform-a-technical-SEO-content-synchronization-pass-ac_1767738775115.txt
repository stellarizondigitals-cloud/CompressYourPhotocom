Perform a technical SEO + content synchronization pass across compressyourphoto.com.

Goals:
1) Fix robots.txt and sitemap.xml so they are served as real static files on Vercel (not intercepted by SPA routing).
2) Make English homepage match the multi-tool suite and update language count to 9.
3) Ensure unique SEO <title> and meta description for /how-it-works and /languages (and avoid duplicates).
4) Fix /enhance route so both /enhance and /enhance/ work consistently and do not 404. Use redirects/canonical to avoid duplicates.
5) Remove/soften any unprovable claims like “trusted by millions worldwide”.
6) Remove or replace placeholder “#” links in Recommended Tools with either real URLs or hide the section until real links exist.
7) Ensure all pages have correct canonical URLs and hreflang alternates for supported languages (en, es, pt, fr, de, hi, zh-cn, ar, id).

Implementation details:

A) Static SEO files
- Ensure these exist at Vite root: public/robots.txt, public/sitemap.xml, public/ads.txt
- robots.txt must be plain text and include:
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Sitemap: https://www.compressyourphoto.com/sitemap.xml

- sitemap.xml MUST be valid XML using <urlset> and include all key URLs for:
  /, /compress, /resize, /convert, /crop, /enhance, /how-it-works, /languages, /privacy-policy, /terms, /cookie-policy, /disclaimer, /contact, /about
  plus language-prefixed equivalents for: es, pt, fr, de, hi, zh-cn, ar, id.
- Remove any URLs that do not actually exist.

B) Vercel SPA routing
- Update or create vercel.json at repo root so it DOES NOT route /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /ads.txt into index.html.
- Ensure these 3 files are served directly.
- Keep SPA rewrite for all other routes.

C) Routing consistency
- Ensure /enhance works (no trailing slash required).
- If you want to standardize trailing slashes, implement redirects to one canonical form.

D) English homepage sync
- Update / (English) so it is a multi-tool landing page like /id:
  - show tool cards for Compress / Resize / Convert / Crop / Enhance
  - update “Available in 9 languages…”
  - keep consistent styling with the rest of the site.

E) Unique SEO titles/descriptions
- Set unique titles + meta descriptions for:
  - /how-it-works  => “How It Works | CompressYourPhoto” + description describing all tools
  - /languages     => “Languages | CompressYourPhoto” + description
- Ensure tool pages also have unique titles (they already seem to).

F) Claims and placeholders
- In /about: replace “trusted by millions worldwide” with a truthful alternative like:
  “A fast, privacy-first browser-based photo toolkit.”
- Replace the Recommended Tools links (#) with real URLs if present in config, otherwise hide the buttons/section.

After completion:
- List all files changed and their paths.
- Show the final contents of public/robots.txt and the first 30 lines of public/sitemap.xml
- Confirm /robots.txt returns plain text and /sitemap.xml returns valid XML in local preview.
