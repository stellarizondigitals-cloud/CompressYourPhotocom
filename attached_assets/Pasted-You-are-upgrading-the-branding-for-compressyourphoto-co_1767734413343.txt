You are upgrading the branding for compressyourphoto.com.

Goal: Create a larger, more eye-catching, unique, modern brand logo and a full favicon set to replace the existing logo/favicon across the site.

Constraints:
- No paid APIs or external services required.
- Everything must be created inside the codebase as SVG/PNG assets and integrated into the site.
- Must look premium, clean, and trustworthy (tools/utility brand).
- Must work on light and dark backgrounds.
- Must scale well for mobile and desktop.

Brand:
- Name: CompressYourPhoto
- Product: photo tools suite (Compress, Resize, Convert, Crop, Enhance)
- Brand keywords: fast, private, simple, powerful, global, modern
- Style: modern minimalist + slight “premium tech” feel
- Colors: use a strong, high-contrast gradient (blue→purple or teal→blue) plus neutral dark text
- Icon concept: “CYP” or a stylized camera/photo frame + compression arrows + sparkle (subtle) to represent enhance
- Avoid generic clipart. Must be unique, geometric, and balanced.

What to do:

---

## 1) Create Logo Assets (SVG)
Create these files in the correct public assets folder used by the app (likely `public/`):

1. `public/brand/logo-mark.svg`
   - Icon only (no text)
   - Square-friendly
   - Must be readable even at 32x32

2. `public/brand/logo-horizontal.svg`
   - Icon + wordmark "CompressYourPhoto"
   - Wordmark should be bold, modern sans-serif look (but as SVG text paths or simple SVG text)
   - Ensure it looks good on white background

3. `public/brand/logo-horizontal-dark.svg`
   - Variant for dark backgrounds (white/near-white wordmark)
   - Same icon

Design requirements for SVG:
- Use clean vector shapes (no raster).
- Use a gradient in the icon (e.g., #2563EB to #7C3AED or #06B6D4 to #2563EB).
- Include a subtle “compression” cue (inward arrows or shrinking frame) plus a tiny sparkle accent to imply enhancement.
- Keep it simple enough to render fast and look sharp.

---

## 2) Create Favicon Set
Create a modern favicon set from the new logo mark.

Create:
- `public/favicon.svg` (from logo-mark)
- `public/favicon.ico` (multi-size if possible: 16/32/48)
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `public/favicon-32x32.png`
- `public/favicon-16x16.png`
- `public/site.webmanifest`

If generating .png/.ico purely in code is hard, you may:
- Keep favicon.svg as primary
- Provide pngs using a simple node script with canvas (if already available), OR generate minimal pngs via a build script.
But prefer to include the correct static files in `public/`.

---

## 3) Integrate Into App UI
Replace the existing logo usages:

- Header/navbar should use the new `logo-horizontal.svg` (large and clear).
- On mobile, use `logo-mark.svg`.
- Update any footer branding to match.
- Ensure it is crisp and not blurry.

If there is a `Logo` component, update it to:
- Render correct variant based on theme/background
- Use responsive sizing:
  - Desktop header: height ~36–44px
  - Mobile header: icon ~28–32px

---

## 4) Update HTML Head References
In `index.html` (or equivalent Vite entry HTML), update:
- favicon links to point to the new assets
- apple-touch-icon
- manifest link
- theme-color (match brand primary, e.g. #2563EB)

Add/ensure:
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="alternate icon" href="/favicon.ico">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">

---

## 5) Manifest Content
Create `public/site.webmanifest` with:
- name: "CompressYourPhoto"
- short_name: "CYP"
- icons entries for 192x192 and 512x512 (create these pngs if possible)
- start_url: "/"
- display: "standalone"
- background_color: "#0B1220" (or white if you prefer)
- theme_color: "#2563EB"

---

## 6) Quality Checks
After changes:
- Verify the logo displays correctly on homepage and tool pages.
- Verify favicon appears in browser tab.
- Verify apple touch icon works.
- Ensure no broken asset paths in production builds.

---

## 7) After completion
Tell me:
- Exact files you created/edited
- Where the logo is used in the app
- Any build steps needed (if you created scripts)

Proceed now. Do not ask me questions; use best practices and implement fully.
