Replit AI Prompt (Foundation SEO Fix)
Update my Vite + React project for compressyourphoto.com to fix SEO infrastructure.

Create a public/robots.txt file (Vite serves /public/* at the site root). Contents:
User-agent: *
Allow: /
 
Sitemap: https://www.compressyourphoto.com/sitemap.xml
Create a public/sitemap.xml file with valid XML and include these URLs (set lastmod to today’s date):
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/how-it-works
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/languages
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/privacy-policy
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/terms
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/cookie-policy
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/disclaimer
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/contact
And also include language entry points:
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/es
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/pt
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/fr
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/de
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/hi
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/zh-cn
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/ar
Create public/ads.txt with a placeholder line and comment indicating it will be updated after AdSense approval:
# ads.txt will be added here after AdSense approval
Ensure these files are included in the Vercel build output and accessible at:
/robots.txt
/sitemap.xml
/ads.txt
Do not change app logic. Only add these files.

Then: Commit → Push → Vercel redeploy.
After deploy, you should be able to open in browser:

https://www.compressyourphoto.com/robots.txt
https://www.compressyourphoto.com/sitemap.xml
If either still shows your SPA 404 page, tell me immediately—your routing rewrite is intercepting static files and we’ll adjust it.

2) On-page SEO upgrades (high impact, low risk)
Goal: Higher CTR + clearer relevance.

Do these next:

Fix the title spacing: Compress Your Photo – Free Online Image Compressor…
Ensure you have a strong meta description (155–160 chars).
Add canonical URL (choose www as canonical).
Add OpenGraph + Twitter tags.
Replit AI Prompt (Head Meta + Title)
Improve SEO meta tags for the homepage.

Open the main Vite index.html (root or under client/ depending on project).
Update the <title> to:
Compress Your Photo – Free Online Image Compressor | JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, GIF
Add a meta description:
Compress JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, and GIF images online for free. Fast, private, client-side compression—your photos stay on your device.
Add canonical:
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.compressyourphoto.com/" />
Add basic OpenGraph and Twitter meta tags (title/description/url/type).
Keep everything else unchanged.

3) Multilingual SEO (so /zh-cn etc can rank)
Goal: Each language path is understood by Google properly.

Add hreflang alternate links (important). This helps Google show the right language version.

You already have path-based languages (/es, /zh-cn, etc). Now we should add:

link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href=".../"
hreflang="es" href=".../es"
…
hreflang="x-default" pointing to /
This can be placed in index.html (static), but better is to manage per-language in React. If you want the simplest approach now, do it in index.html.

4) Content strategy to actually compete (this is what wins rankings)
A single page can rank, but “#1” for huge keywords usually requires more pages.

Best approach (still “one app”):
Create dedicated landing pages:

/compress-jpg
/compress-png
/compress-webp
/compress-heic
/compress-gif
/reduce-image-size
/bulk-image-compressor
Each page:

targets one keyword cluster
has 300–800 words of helpful content + FAQs
links back into the same compressor UI (same component)
This is how you beat generic tools long-term.

After you do Step 1 (robots + sitemap), we do “registration”
To get indexed fast:

Google Search Console: add your site + submit sitemap
Bing Webmaster Tools: add site + submit sitemap
You don’t need code for this—just verification and sitemap submission.
