In the CompressYourPhoto project, implement real client-side image compression in the UploadDropzone and create a simple compression control + results UI.

1. Install dependencies:
   - `browser-image-compression` for client-side compression.
   - `jszip` for creating ZIPs when multiple images are compressed.

2. Update UploadDropzone.tsx:
   - Accept drag-and-drop and click-to-upload for multiple files.
   - Accept types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif, image/heic if supported by the browser.
   - When files are selected:
     - Store them in component state as an array with:
       - originalFile
       - compressedFile (initially null)
       - status: 'pending' | 'compressing' | 'done' | 'error'
       - originalSize, compressedSize, errorMessage (optional)

3. Add a simple compression controls panel below the dropzone:
   - Quality slider (0.1 to 1.0, default 0.8).
   - Target max width in pixels (optional, e.g. input number, default blank meaning no resize).
   - Output format dropdown: "Keep original", "JPG", "PNG", "WebP".
   - A "Compress Images" button.

4. Implement the compression behavior using `browser-image-compression`:
   - On click of "Compress Images":
     - For each selected file, run imageCompression with options:
       - maxWidthOrHeight: use the target width if specified, otherwise no limit.
       - initialQuality: based on the quality slider.
       - fileType: map from the chosen output format (if "Keep original", pass undefined).
     - Update each file's status to 'compressing', then 'done' or 'error'.
     - Store the resulting compressed File/Blob and its size.

5. Results display:
   - Under the controls, show a list of compressed images:
     - For each, show:
       - Filename
       - Original size (KB/MB) and compressed size, and % reduction.
       - A "Download" button for that single image.
   - If there are multiple compressed images, show a "Download All as ZIP" button that:
       - Uses JSZip to add each compressed file.
       - Generates a ZIP Blob and triggers a download (e.g. `compressed-photos.zip`).

6. UX:
   - Show a small progress indicator (e.g. "Compressing X of Y images...") when compression is in progress.
   - Handle errors gracefully and show a localized error message for unsupported types or failures.
   - All user-facing text must use i18next (`useTranslation()` and keys in locale JSON).

7. Performance:
   - Ensure compression runs fully client-side; do not add any network calls.
   - Consider using `await` with Promise.all for compressing multiple files, but keep the UI responsive.

Do not introduce any backend code, servers, or paid services. Everything must run entirely in the browser on free tiers.
